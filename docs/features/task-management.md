# Task Management

The task management system helps you create, organize, and track actionable items through natural conversation with your AI assistant.

## Overview

Tasks are actionable items that you need to complete. The AI assistant can create tasks from your natural language input, organize them, and help you track their progress.

## Creating Tasks

### Natural Language Input
Simply tell the AI what you need to do:

```
"Remind me to call John tomorrow about the project"
"I need to review the quarterly report by Friday"
"Add a task to schedule a meeting with the design team"
"Don't forget to update the project timeline"
```

### Task Details
The AI automatically extracts:

- **Title**: Clear, actionable task description
- **Description**: Additional context and details
- **Due Date**: When the task should be completed
- **Priority**: Importance level (high, medium, low)
