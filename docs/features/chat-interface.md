## Usage Patterns

### Simple Notes
For quick notes and reminders:

```
"I need to remember that the meeting is at 3 PM tomorrow"
"Note: The new feature should include dark mode support"
"Remember: Check with Sarah about the budget proposal"
```

### Task Creation
For actionable items:

```
"Remind me to call John tomorrow about the project"
"Add a task to review the quarterly report by Friday"
"I need to schedule a meeting with the design team"
```

### Brain Dumps
For complex, unstructured thoughts:

```
"I've been thinking about the new product launch. We need to consider the marketing strategy, 
budget allocation, timeline, team assignments, and risk mitigation. Also, we should probably 
do some market research first and maybe run some focus groups to validate our assumptions."
```

### Conversations
For general discussion and questions:

```
"How are my tasks looking today?"
"Can you help me organize my thoughts about the project?"
"What notes do I have about the client meeting?"
```
