# Note Organization

The note organization system intelligently structures your thoughts, ideas, and information into well-organized, searchable notes.

## Overview

Notes capture information, ideas, and thoughts that you want to remember. The AI assistant automatically organizes your input into structured notes with titles, sections, and tags for easy retrieval and reference.

## Creating Notes

### Simple Notes
For quick information capture:

```
"I need to remember that the meeting is at 3 PM tomorrow"
"Note: The new feature should include dark mode support"
"Remember: Check with Sarah about the budget proposal"
```

### Structured Notes
For organized information:

```
"Meeting notes from today: discussed the new feature requirements, 
decided to use React for the frontend, and scheduled a follow-up for next week"
```

### Brain Dumps
For complex, unstructured thoughts:

```
"I've been thinking about the new product launch. We need to consider the marketing strategy, 
budget allocation, timeline, team assignments, and risk mitigation. Also, we should probably 
do some market research first and maybe run some focus groups to validate our assumptions."
```
