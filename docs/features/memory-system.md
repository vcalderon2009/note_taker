# Memory System

The memory system enables the AI assistant to remember context across conversations, providing a more personalized and intelligent experience.

## Overview

The memory system consists of two main components: short-term memory (conversation context) and long-term memory (persistent knowledge). This allows the AI to maintain context within conversations and remember important information across sessions.

## Short-term Memory

### Conversation Context
The AI remembers the current conversation:

- **Message History**: All messages in the current chat
- **Context Clues**: References to earlier messages
- **User Preferences**: Communication style and needs
- **Current Topics**: What you're discussing

### Context Awareness
The AI uses context to:

- **Reference Previous Messages**: "As you mentioned earlier..."
- **Maintain Topic Continuity**: Keep discussions on track
- **Provide Relevant Responses**: Tailor answers to context
- **Ask Follow-up Questions**: Build on previous information

### Example Usage
```
You: "I need to remember to call John tomorrow about the project"
AI: "I've created a task for you to call John tomorrow about the project."

You: "What time should I call him?"
AI: "I don't see a specific time mentioned for calling John about the project. 
     Would you like me to add a time to the task, or do you have a preference?"
```

## Long-term Memory (Planned)

### Persistent Knowledge
The AI will remember across sessions:

- **User Information**: Name, preferences, and patterns
- **Important Facts**: Key information about you and your work
- **Relationship Context**: People, projects, and connections
- **Historical Data**: Past conversations and decisions

### Memory Types
Different types of long-term memory:

- **Episodic Memory**: Specific events and conversations
- **Semantic Memory**: General knowledge and facts
- **Procedural Memory**: How to do things
- **Associative Memory**: Connections between concepts

### Memory Retrieval
The AI will retrieve relevant information:

- **Contextual Recall**: Remember relevant past information
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify recurring themes
- **Predictive Memory**: Anticipate needs based on history
- **Cross-reference**: Connect related information

## Memory Features

### Automatic Memory
The AI automatically remembers:

- **Important Information**: Key facts and details
- **User Preferences**: Communication style and needs
- **Patterns**: Recurring topics and behaviors
- **Context**: Conversation flow and topics

### Manual Memory
You can explicitly tell the AI to remember:

```
"Remember that I prefer morning meetings"
"Note that John is the project manager for the website redesign"
"Keep in mind that the budget is $50,000"
"Remember that I work from home on Fridays"
```

### Memory Updates
Update stored information:

```
"Update my preference - I now prefer afternoon meetings"
"John is no longer the project manager, it's Sarah now"
"The budget has been increased to $75,000"
"I now work from home on Mondays and Fridays"
```

## Memory Organization

### Categories
Memory is organized by category:

- **Personal**: Personal information and preferences
- **Work**: Professional information and projects
- **Relationships**: People and connections
- **Projects**: Specific projects and their details
- **Preferences**: User preferences and settings

### Tags and Labels
Memory items are tagged for easy retrieval:

- **Context Tags**: Meeting, project, personal
- **Importance Tags**: Critical, important, nice-to-know
- **Time Tags**: Recent, historical, ongoing
- **Type Tags**: Fact, preference, relationship

### Memory Hierarchy
Organized in a hierarchy:

- **High-level**: General categories and topics
- **Mid-level**: Specific areas and projects
- **Detailed**: Specific facts and information
- **Contextual**: Related and connected information

## Memory Management

### Viewing Memory
Access your memory through:

1. **Memory Dashboard**: Overview of stored information
2. **Search**: Find specific memory items
3. **Categories**: Browse by category
4. **Timeline**: View memory by date

### Memory Updates
Modify stored information:

```
"Update my work schedule to include remote days"
"Change the project deadline to next month"
"Add Sarah to the team for the new project"
"Remove the old budget information"
```

### Memory Cleanup
Maintain your memory:

```
"Archive old project information"
"Remove outdated preferences"
"Clean up duplicate information"
"Update contact information"
```

## Privacy and Security

### Data Protection
Your memory is protected:

- **Encryption**: All data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Access Control**: Only you can access your memory
- **Data Isolation**: Your data is separate from others
- **Retention Policies**: Configurable data retention

### Privacy Controls
Control what is remembered:

- **Memory Settings**: Choose what to remember
- **Deletion**: Remove specific memory items
- **Anonymization**: Remove personal identifiers
- **Export**: Download your memory data

### Security Measures
Protect your information:

- **Authentication**: Secure access to your data
- **Authorization**: Control who can access what
- **Audit Logs**: Track memory access and changes
- **Backup**: Regular backups of your data

## Best Practices

### Memory Creation
1. **Be Specific**: Clear, detailed information
2. **Include Context**: Relevant background information
3. **Use Categories**: Organize information logically
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep information current

### Memory Organization
1. **Consistent Structure**: Use similar formats
2. **Clear Labels**: Descriptive tags and categories
3. **Regular Review**: Check and update regularly
4. **Clean Up**: Remove outdated information

### Memory Usage
1. **Reference Information**: Use stored knowledge
2. **Ask Questions**: Query your memory
3. **Update Regularly**: Keep information current
4. **Share Appropriately**: Control information sharing
